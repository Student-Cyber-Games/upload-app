## üìù File Location

The `tourdeapp.yaml` is a YAML which should be placed in the root directory of your project repository.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The file HAS to be named exactly `tourdeapp.yaml`, different file extensions, such as `.yml`, are not supported.

## üóúÔ∏è Environment substitution

If `tourdeapp.yaml` is used with our `upload-app` GitHub action, it supports environment variable substitution using the mustache syntax `{{ENV_VAR}}`.
You just have to pass an environment variable named `ENV_VAR` to the action, and it will replace all instances of `{{ENV_VAR}}` in the `tourdeapp.yaml` file with the value of the environment variable:

```yaml
- name: Upload to TdA
  uses: Student-Cyber-Games/upload-app@v1
  env:
    ENV_VAR: ${{ secrets.API_KEY_ENV_VAR }}
```
